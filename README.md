# Recipe Recommender, Classifier, and Generator!

Our group has worked on a number of projects related to the overarching theme of online recipes. We have prepared a huge database of over one million recipes, so that a user can easily type in their desired ingredients and obtain recipes that use them. We have programmed and trained a machine learning model to classify recipes by cuisine. Finally, we have also written several ML models that generate new recipes.
